## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS Grid during this project and I had much fun building it because it felt like a full page and not only mini cards like the other projects. So it's a good challenge that I'm proud of completing.
I also learned more about media queries as I tried to use more than one to make as responsive as possible.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "box1 box2"
    "box3 box3";
}
```
